                                        <br>This project is motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the past 7 days, an
                                        average of 152,695 new cases were reported daily.
                                        I used <b>NetLogo</b> platform and the <b>HubNet</b> extension to build two
                                        microworlds that could simulate the COVID-19 transmission risks.
                                        Both microworlds will simulate a group of students who go to school daily and
                                        continuously track the number of positive and negative cases.
                                        <u>This project will be used to help audiences learn about the effectiveness of
                                            each safety measure that would help prevent the spread of the disease,
                                            such as wearing a mask, getting vaccinated, maintaining social distancing,
                                            and isolation</u>. Based on the barrier of the basic statistic knowledge,
                                        the project would be presented in a high school classroom. Students could play
                                        with the value of each parameter and identify any interesting patterns
                                        or rules inside the model from their calculation and observation.

                                        that is able to check the mask-wearing in a public transportation scenario.
                                        <br>The robot includes:
                                        <br><u>Face mask detection algorithm</u> to track masks and human faces<br>
                                        <u>Driving control</u> to enable the robot move to the preset locations <br>

                                        <i>Sleepventure</i> is a first-person adventure game. The game is broken up into
                                        two worlds: the 3D world that the player lives in and the 2D
                                        world the player enters when he falls asleep. The story has an exaggerated
                                        real-world setting during the COVID-19 pandemic. The character
                                        works from home every day, and does daily tasks - attending zoom meetings,
                                        working, and watching TV. Once the character finishes his daily
                                        tasks, he will go to bed and fall asleep. Then, dimensionality reduction will
                                        take place and the character will be sent to a random 2D world
                                        with a random role and scenario. The character may become a warrior from an
                                        ancient empire, a space shuttle captain, a kid in kindergarten,
                                        or an alien from the planet Flucan (inspired by Vulcan from Star Trek). There
                                        are different primary goals for each scenario in the 2D world
                                        but the ultimate goal is to finish the map and reach the destination. Once the
                                        character finishes the map, runs out of time, or dies midway,
                                        the character will be automatically sent back to the 3D world and wake up. The
                                        character needs to perform his daily routines again, in order
                                        to get tired enough to sleep. <br>
                                        The 3D world is depicted as dystopian where the character sufferers every day,
                                        and the 2D world, in contrast, becomes a utopia for the character to escape from
                                        reality.
                                        As the character enters the 2D world more often, he grows increasingly to rely
                                        on fantasy and wants to stay longer in the 2D world. With the hidden guides from
                                        the 2D world,
                                        (i.e. ‚ÄúEverything you see and experience is fake‚Äù), he questions himself if the
                                        3D world is a hoax and the 2D world is the actual reality he belongs to.
                                        Finally, the character decides
                                        to swallow half a bottle of sedative hypnotics to stay in the 2D world forever,
                                        and the game ends.
