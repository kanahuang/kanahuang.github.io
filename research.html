                                                    This study seeks to understand <b>if digital tools can promote critical reflection </b>. 
                                                    Critical reflection is classified as transformative reflection which is situated, 
                                                    and cyclic, using multiple perspectives and considering aspects beyond the current context [1, 2].
                                                    Critical reflection could be crucial for college students as it encourages people to be better 
                                                    people and better to others, which could eventually improve their well-being and mental health [3,4].
                                                    Our completed scoping review identified that there is a lack of tools that support critical reflection, the deepest level of self-reflection. 
                                                    Thus, in this study, we conduct <u>a field deployment of two different interactive prototypes that ask people to track their moods </u>.

                                                        In recent years, we have seen a growing prevalence of mental health concerns, resulting in a need for more 
                                                        research on scalable, effective interventions. Self-reflection is an important, evidence-based skill that can improve mental health. 
                                                        In response to the growing demand for digital interventions that support self-reflection and mental health, we review how self-reflection
                                                         has been conceptualized in HCI research thus far. Using a scoping review, we look at prior work designing and evaluating self-reflection 
                                                         for mental health (SRMH) interventions. <b>We found no uniform definition of “self-reflection,” so we present a five-component definition that 
                                                         allows for a flexible definition.</b> This five- component definition gives researchers and designers the ability to communicate their ideas using a 
                                                        systematic approach, compare components of SRMH interventions, and uncover novel interventions. We present recommendations and 
                                                        avenues of research that will standardized and promote innovation within SRMH interventions and digital mental health tools.

                                                        Recycling is one of the most significant issues in the waste management system. As the use and demand for plastics increase every year, 
                                                        finding efficient and environment-friendly solutions to handle the plastics in the plastic waste management system gets more challenging.
                                                         There are economic, environmental, and educational factors affecting plastic waste management. This paper investigates the effects of 
                                                         educational campaigns and system-wide improvement. For this, we used an Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation approach in the NetLogo 
                                                         environment. We provided various scenarios in the current plastics waste life cycle using a real dataset to validate our model, which 
                                                         was from the American Chemistry Council and the National Association for PET Container Resources from 2018. We found that education, 
                                                         technology, and infrastructure changes should be considered holistically to overcome this problem at a system level.
