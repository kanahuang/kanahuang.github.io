                                        In recent years, we have seen a growing prevalence of mental health concerns,
                                        resulting in a need for more
                                        research on scalable, effective interventions. Self-reflection is an important,
                                        evidence-based skill that can improve mental health.
                                        In response to the growing demand for digital interventions that support
                                        self-reflection and mental health, we review how self-reflection
                                        has been conceptualized in HCI research thus far. Using a scoping review, we
                                        look at prior work designing and evaluating self-reflection
                                        for mental health (SRMH) interventions. <b>We found no uniform definition of
                                        “self-reflection,” so we present a five-component definition that
                                        allows for a flexible definition.</b> This five- component definition gives
                                        researchers and designers the ability to communicate their ideas using a
                                        systematic approach, compare components of SRMH interventions, and uncover novel
                                        interventions. We present recommendations and
                                        avenues of research that will standardized and promote innovation within SRMH
                                        interventions and digital mental health tools.

                                        Recycling is one of the most significant issues in the waste management system.
                                        As the use and demand for plastics increase every year,
                                        finding efficient and environment-friendly solutions to handle the plastics in
                                        the plastic waste management system gets more challenging.
                                        There are economic, environmental, and educational factors affecting plastic
                                        waste management. This paper investigates the effects of
                                        educational campaigns and system-wide improvement. For this, we used an
                                        Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation approach in the NetLogo
                                        environment. We provided various scenarios in the current plastics waste life
                                        cycle using a real dataset to validate our model, which
                                        was from the American Chemistry Council and the National Association for PET
                                        Container Resources from 2018. We found that education,
                                        technology, and infrastructure changes should be considered holistically to
                                        overcome this problem at a system level.
