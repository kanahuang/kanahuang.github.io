                                        Recent advances in conversational AI and the ubiquity of related devices and applications---from robots to smart speakers to 
                                        chatbots---has led to extensive research on designing and studying conversational systems with older adults. Despite a growing
                                         literature on this topic, many studies examine small groups of older adults and specific devices, neglecting a holistic
                                          understanding of how diverse groups of older adults perceive conversational interaction more broadly. We present a systematic
                                           review that analyzes older adults' perceptions of and preferences for AI-based conversational systems based on research
                                            published from 2010 to mid 2024. Our findings synthesize older adults’ perceptions of the challenges and opportunities
                                             for interacting with these systems. We highlight their vision for future AI-based conversational systems, emphasizing 
                                             a desire for more human-like interactions, personalization, and greater control over their information. We discuss 
                                             the implications for future research and design of conversational AI systems for older adults.

                                        Patient-generated data (PGD) is valuable to providers but is often overwhelmingly
                                         large and difficult to use in practice. Researchers have a limited understanding
                                          of how tools can surface data insights useful for clinical decision-making. A particular
                                           gap is how data-centric technologies can support clinical decision-making for patients
                                            with comorbidities. We interviewed 11 providers from Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs)
                                             treating patients with metabolic syndrome. Providers wanted patients to collect different data
                                              depending on the sets of comorbidities they experienced and patient behaviors. Providers anticipated
                                               data values based on social determinants of health. Providers discussed how they would
                                                contextualize data events based on medical history and context. We discuss how customized data selection
                                                 tools, and contextualizing data events with provider heuristics related to patient characteristics can support clinical decision-making..

                                        In recent years, we have seen a growing prevalence of mental health concerns,
                                        resulting in a need for more
                                        research on scalable, effective interventions. Self-reflection is an important,
                                        evidence-based skill that can improve mental health.
                                        In response to the growing demand for digital interventions that support
                                        self-reflection and mental health, we review how self-reflection
                                        has been conceptualized in HCI research thus far. Using a scoping review, we
                                        look at prior work designing and evaluating self-reflection
                                        for mental health (SRMH) interventions. <b>We found no uniform definition of
                                        “self-reflection,” so we present a five-component definition that
                                        allows for a flexible definition.</b> This five- component definition gives
                                        researchers and designers the ability to communicate their ideas using a
                                        systematic approach, compare components of SRMH interventions, and uncover novel
                                        interventions. We present recommendations and
                                        avenues of research that will standardized and promote innovation within SRMH
                                        interventions and digital mental health tools.

                                        Recycling is one of the most significant issues in the waste management system.
                                        As the use and demand for plastics increase every year,
                                        finding efficient and environment-friendly solutions to handle the plastics in
                                        the plastic waste management system gets more challenging.
                                        There are economic, environmental, and educational factors affecting plastic
                                        waste management. This paper investigates the effects of
                                        educational campaigns and system-wide improvement. For this, we used an
                                        Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation approach in the NetLogo
                                        environment. We provided various scenarios in the current plastics waste life
                                        cycle using a real dataset to validate our model, which
                                        was from the American Chemistry Council and the National Association for PET
                                        Container Resources from 2018. We found that education,
                                        technology, and infrastructure changes should be considered holistically to
                                        overcome this problem at a system level.
